# CSCI-1101 Super Mario Bros.

TODO: [GAMEPLAY IMAGE HERE]

## Why We Made This Game

This game was developed by a team of curious students eager to deepen their understanding of programming. As the project lead, I guided the group through the entire process, using the game as a hands-on way to teach game development, Python, and Pygame. Itâ€™s a fun, collaborative effort that allowed everyone to learn by building something exciting together.
